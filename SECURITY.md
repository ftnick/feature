   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
   - Any potential impact on the system.

   We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** and provide you with a plan for how we will address the issue. You can expect regular updates on the status of the fix.

3. **Response and Timeline**:
   - If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to release a patch or mitigation as soon as possible, generally within **7-14 days**, depending on the severity and complexity of the issue.
   - If the vulnerability is not accepted (i.e., it doesn't meet the criteria for a security risk), we will explain why.
